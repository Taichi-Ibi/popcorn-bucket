**Customization Ideas:**
- Add your own priority levels (üö® Urgent, ‚≠ê Nice-to-have)
- Create team-specific sections (üë• Team Tasks, üè† Remote Work)
- Use different emojis or no emojis at all
- Add time estimates, assignees, or due dates
- Create project-specific categories
- Use whatever structure works best for your workflow!
